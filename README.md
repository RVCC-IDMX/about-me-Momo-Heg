## Description
### About the Project
Hi, I’m Mahmoud Hegazi! This About Me project is a personal webpage I’m creating for my RVCC coursework. It is designed to showcase my web development skills in a portfolio I can share with potential employers.

### Features
The site features sections for:
- Biography
- Hobbies
- Image Gallery
- Blog Article
- Video
- Contact Form

All sections are styled with a dark, minimalist theme that reflects my love for contrast and visual impact.

### Learning Goals
Through this project, I’m learning to build a semantic, responsive design using HTML and CSS. Below are some highlights:
- **Biography Section**: Structured content with proper HTML semantics, added a styled profile picture, and wrote a detailed introduction about my journey and goals.
- **Hobbies Section**: Styled lists with CSS Flexbox, describing my seven hobbies in depth.
- **Image Gallery**: Used CSS Grid to create a responsive layout (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablets, 3 on laptops) with hover effects for interactivity.
- **Blog Article**: Wrote a 614-word article on image hover effects, including visual examples like a fading image and an overlay with text.

### Accessibility and Testing
I ensured accessibility with a contrast ratio above 4.5:1 and tested responsiveness on devices like iPhone 6, iPad, and larger displays.
### Logo
I created a text-only "MH" monogram logo to represent my personal brand, saved as img/MH Logo (4).png. It uses whitesmoke for the text to match my site’s headings, with a transparent background that blends with the header’s #1F2741 background. Here’s the logo:

### Color Scheme
My site uses a cool-toned, minimalist theme for readability and visual appeal. Here are the primary colors:

Background (Deep Navy Blue): rgb(16, 24, 51), #101833
Text (Light Bluish-Gray): rgb(157, 165, 192), #9DA5C0
Section Background (Lighter Navy Blue): rgb(31, 39, 65), #1F2741
Accent (Soft Blue): rgb(152, 172, 235), #98ACEB
Headings (Light Gray): whitesmoke, #F5F5F5

I verified the contrast ratio between the text (#9DA5C0) and background (#101833) using the Contrast Checker, achieving 9.8:1, well above the 4.5:1 minimum for accessibility.
### Code Validation
To ensure my code meets web standards, I validated my HTML and CSS using the W3C validators:

- **HTML**: Validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **CSS**: Validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

This process helped me catch and fix syntax errors, ensuring my site is professional and accessible.

### Blog Article
I added a 614-word blog article on image hover effects, explaining how they work, their uses, and showing two visual examples:

Fade Effect: My moonlight image fades to 70% opacity on hover using the opacity property.
Overlay Effect: My sunset image shows a dark overlay with the text “Golden Sunset” on hover.The article is written in a simple, beginner-friendly tone and styled with CSS to match my site’s theme, including centered examples and code snippets.

Planned Features
Here’s what I’ve included and plan to add:

Responsive Design: The site adapts to iPhone 6 (375x667), iPad (768x1024), and larger displays (1200x800) using media queries.
Image Gallery: Features photos (moonlight, sky heart, sunset) styled with CSS Grid and hover effects.
Blog Article: A 614-word article on image hover effects, with visual examples and at least three cited sources.
Typography: Using Google Fonts (Roboto for body text, Barriecito for headings) for a modern, playful aesthetic.
Video Section: Embedded a YouTube video about a sun eclipse, styled responsively.
Contact Form: Added a Netlify form for user interaction.
